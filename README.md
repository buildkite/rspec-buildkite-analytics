# RSpec Buildkite Insights

A RSpec gem to gather insights from your Test Suite.

## Installation

```ruby
group :test do
  gem "rspec-buildkite-insights", require: false
end
```

Get your Suite Key from Buildkite Test Insights then add the following to your `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
if ENV["CI"]
  require "rspec/buildkite/insights"
  RSpec::Buildkite::Insights.configure(token: "YOUR SUITE KEY")
end
```

Modify allowed host from VCR / WebMock if necessary.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rake test` to run the tests.

## Collecting insights data locally

If you want to run your tests on your local development environment and see the test data files that it generates, pass in a BUILDKITE_INSIGHTS_TOKEN with a value that includes "local", i.e.

`BUILDKITE_INSIGHTS_TOKEN=local rspec spec`

The files will be available at ./tmp
