module Buildkite::TestCollector
  # Traces the execution of an application by creating and storing spans of information.
  #
  # This class contains two data structures:
  #
  # - A stack (called @stack) that traces the entering & leaving of each part of the application.
  # - A tree made up of many Span nodes. Each Span is a node in the tree. Each
  #   span is also stored in the stack. The root of the tree is called @top and
  #   is stored at @stack[0].
  #
  # When the trace is complete the stack MUST contain a single node @top, which
  # is the root of the tree (see #finalize). The tree is converted into a hash
  # in #as_json which recursively calls #as_json on all of it's children.
